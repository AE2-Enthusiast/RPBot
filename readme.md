# RPBot

This is a bot made for a private discord.

This is the master branch of the repo. Code here is **devolopment** code and such should not be used as a bot. Code that should actually be used will be forked into a seperate branch to preserve each version of the bot.

The current features of the bot is tracking of a preset array of strings and how much each user says them. The one functional command can be used to query the count of a specific word for a specific user.
